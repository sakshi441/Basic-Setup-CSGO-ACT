## Welcome to ACT CSGO Tournament

Following are the most basic things you need to set up and be ready before your match starts:

### MOSS

 You need to set up MOSS, it is kind of an anti-cheat software that collects data from your system when you run the game to make sure you are not hacking:
 

1.) Go to the website to download MOSS: [nohope.eu](https://nohope.eu) 
2.) On the right hand side, download MOSS 



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sikander441/actCSGOsetup/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
