## Welcome to ACT CSGO Tournament

Following are the most basic things you need to set up and be ready before your match starts:

### MOSS

 You need to set up MOSS, it is kind of an anti-cheat software that collects data from your system when you run the game to make sure you are not hacking:
 

1.) Go to the website to download MOSS: [nohope.eu](https://nohope.eu) 

2.) On the right hand side, download MOSS as shown in the image below

 I have highligted the 64-bit version you can select the middle one for 32-bit system.
 
3.) Extract the zip to some location on your computer and run the executable(.exe) file presend under the extracted location.( Be sure you don't have CSGO opened when you do this. close it before opening MOSS).

4.) After the app launched click on File - > Parameters and select Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as shown in the image below

 NOTE: You have to do this just once, it will save those parameters.
 
 Click OK to save the parameter.
 
5.) After saving the parameter and coming back to MOSS main application, click on Capture -> Start (Again make sure CSGO is not opened otherwise this will fail).

6.) The MOSS application will show the message that Counter-Strike:Global Offensive Capture is Running. Now you can launch the game and start playing.

7.) After you are done with your match, you can stop the caputre by again going to the MOSS app and capture -> Stop


  
 


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sikander441/actCSGOsetup/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
